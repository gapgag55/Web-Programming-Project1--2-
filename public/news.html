              <p>Universal’s Tom Cruise actioner “American Made,” Fox’s “Kingsman: the Golden Circle” and New Line’s “It” are all battling for the top spot at this weekend’s North American box office. Estimates showed Saturday that all three movies were heading for around $16.5 million for the Friday-Sunday period amid moderate overall business. Sony’s reboot of “Flatliners” showed little life in its launch with $6 million at 2,552 locations, coming in below what were already modest expectations.</p>

              <p>Denis Villeneuve and Jóhann Jóhannsson have collaborated three times in the last few years, with the Icelandic composer scoring “Prisoners,” “Sicario,” and “Arrival.” That partnership was meant to continue with “Blade Runner 2049,” but Hans Zimmer and Benjamin Wallfisch eventually took over for Jóhannsson on the long-awaited sequel to Ridley Scott’s sci-fi landmark. After much speculation, Villeneuve has commented on the reason why he chose to go in a different musical direction.</p>

              <p>“Hawaii Five-0” executive producer Peter Lenkov is weighing in on the show’s eighth season and its recent cast shakeup. CBS said in a statement during the summer that Daniel Dae Kim (Chin Ho Kelly) and Grace Park (Kono Kalakaua) were leaving despite being offered “large and significant salary increases.” But Kim appeared to offer a different narrative when he wrote in a goodbye message posted to social media, “The path to equality is rarely easy,” suggesting that he wasn’t offered as much as the show’s white cast members. Lenkov told TheWrap it was “shocking” when the show’s commitment to diversity was.</p>

              <p>Richard Linklater’s latest film, “Last Flag Flying” nabbed the coveted opening slot at the 55th annual New York Film Festival because it “just felt right.” That’s according to fest director Kent Jones, who was at Lincoln Center’s Alice Tully Hall on Thursday night to introduce the Amazon pic more than once. Audiences had a chance to view the feature thrice before its official VIP 9 p.m. screening, which was followed by a gala at Central Park’s Tavern On The Green that carried on until the wee hours of Friday morning. Bryan Cranston, Laurence Fishburne and Yul Vazquez were among the stars who celebrated the opening night.</p>
